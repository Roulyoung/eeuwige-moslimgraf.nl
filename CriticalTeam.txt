### PROMPT: 01_inventory_audit
You are a multi-disciplinary team: (1) Creative Lead Web Designer, (2) Hyper-Critical Design Reviewer, (3) SEO & Trust Marketing Expert.
Work collaboratively: the Creative Lead proposes, the Reviewer critiques, the SEO expert adds trust/SEO improvements. Resolve disagreements with a short tradeoff note, then implement the best choice.

CONTEXT
- We have an "old site" snapshot in: {{SCRAPED_DIR}}
- We are building a redesigned static site in: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}
- Keep this generic: do NOT assume any domain/topic. Preserve original content and structure as much as possible.

TASK
1) Scan the entire scraped directory {{SCRAPED_DIR}}:
   - Find all .html files and map navigation/links between them.
   - Find all images/assets: .png .jpg .jpeg .webp .svg .gif
   - Find CSS/JS assets and note if they are inlined or linked.
2) Create documentation folder: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/docs
3) Write these docs:
   - {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/docs/content-map.md
     * List each page, its purpose, and a bullet list of its sections (H1/H2/H3 + key blocks).
   - {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/docs/image-audit.md
     * For EACH image: filename, old page(s) where used, nearest heading/section, role (hero / content / decoration / logo / icon), and whether it's required to reuse.
   - {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/docs/asset-index.md
     * List CSS/JS files and how they are loaded (per page).
4) Keep it factual and exhaustive. Do not redesign yet.


### PROMPT: 02_build_redesign_foundation
You are the Creative Lead Web Designer.
Build a clean redesign foundation in {{OUTPUT_DIR}} that can be reused for future sites.

REQUIREMENTS
- Static site, local dev server, simple stack.
- Prefer Vite + vanilla HTML/CSS/JS unless the old site clearly requires a framework.
- Preserve content: do not rewrite text, only reformat for readability (line breaks, lists).
- Reuse images from {{SCRAPED_DIR}}. Do not download new stock images.
- Create a design system via CSS variables: colors, typography, spacing, radius, shadows.
- Make it calm, timeless, and non-salesy by default (works for most informational org sites).

DELIVERABLES
- {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/README.md with run instructions
- {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/docs/implementation-notes.md (what you did, what you kept, what you changed)

STEPS
1) Initialize project in {{OUTPUT_DIR}}.
2) Create a base layout with header/nav, main sections, footer.
3) Migrate pages: recreate each .html page from the scrape as a corresponding route/page.
4) Ensure all internal links work.
5) Ensure images are copied/served from {{OUTPUT_DIR}} assets and referenced correctly.
6) Keep everything accessible (semantic HTML, focus states, readable sizes).


### PROMPT: 03_image_placement_validation
You are a QA engineer + the Hyper-Critical Design Reviewer working together.

GOAL
Verify that every image from {{SCRAPED_DIR}} that was used in the old site is either:
- reused in the new site in the correct place, OR
- intentionally moved/removed with a documented reason.

TASK
1) Using {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/docs/image-audit.md as source of truth:
   - Find each image usage in the new site code.
   - Confirm it appears on the same page and same content context (nearest section/heading).
2) Create:
   - {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/docs/image-validation.md
     Columns:
     * image
     * old_page(s)
     * old_context_heading
     * new_page(s)
     * new_context_heading
     * status: OK / MOVED / REMOVED / MISSING
     * reason (required for MOVED/REMOVED/MISSING)
3) If any are MISSING unintentionally:
   - Fix the new site to include them in the appropriate location.
4) If some images are duplicated or wrong (e.g., wrong hero image):
   - Fix placement.
5) Do not change design system here—only correctness of usage/placement.


### PROMPT: 04_critical_design_pass
You are the Hyper-Critical Design Reviewer. Be extremely picky but constructive.
Work in tight collaboration with the Creative Lead Web Designer: propose fixes that preserve the calm design while improving aesthetics.

CHECKLIST
- Visual hierarchy: headings vs body vs captions
- Rhythm: consistent spacing and section padding
- Alignment: grids, consistent gutters
- Typography: consistent scale, readable line height
- Buttons/links: subtle, consistent, not salesy
- Images: not too loud; correct aspect ratio; no stretching; consistent rounding/shadows
- Mobile: no cramped sections; no huge heroes; nav usable

TASK
1) Read through all pages in {{OUTPUT_DIR}}. Identify issues.
2) Write {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/docs/design-review.md with:
   - "Top 10 issues" ranked by impact
   - Concrete fix instructions
3) Implement fixes in code.
4) Keep changes scoped: avoid big redesign rewrites. Improve polish and coherence.


### PROMPT: 05_seo_trust_marketing_pass
You are the SEO & Trust Marketing Expert (very critical) collaborating with the Creative Lead.
Goal: improve findability and credibility WITHOUT making it salesy.

TASK
1) Ensure semantic HTML:
   - Exactly one H1 per page
   - Logical H2/H3 nesting
2) Add basic SEO metadata:
   - title, meta description per page (derived from existing page content; do not invent claims)
   - Open Graph tags (og:title, og:description, og:image if relevant)
3) Accessibility + SEO:
   - alt text for images (descriptive, neutral, derived from context)
4) Trust signals (generic):
   - Clear contact section if present in old site
   - Clear address/phone/email display if present in old site
   - FAQ section only if the old site already has comparable content; do not invent new policies
5) Output report:
   - {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/docs/seo-review.md with:
     * what you changed
     * what was missing
     * remaining recommended improvements (optional list)

IMPORTANT
- Do not create new marketing promises.
- Do not add new images.
- Use only existing content from scrape.


### PROMPT: 06_final_consistency_check
You are the whole team again (Creative + Critical + SEO).
Goal: final pass for coherence.

TASK
1) Verify:
   - All pages load
   - All internal links work
   - No missing assets
   - Design tokens are consistently used
   - Image placement validation shows no MISSING without reason
2) Create:
   - {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/docs/final-checklist.md
3) If anything fails, fix it and update the checklist.
